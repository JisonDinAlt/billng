      Categories example: 'Payment categories contain two types, payment ( displayed and counted with a "-" sign, for example, "-23.34") and contribution ( is counted with a "+" sign, displayed without signs, for example, "23.34") '
      Types example: 'Payment types are divided into 2 types, depending on the category. For payment, there are types of expenses - "home", "auto", "entertainment". For contribution - "regular" and "not regular".'
      Logic example: 'The total balance is: from the sum of all  contribution  deduct the amount of all payments in the payment . The type of payment is attached to the category through the lookup_code field.'
